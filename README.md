bike computer code for raspberry pi

Create folder test_data. Then either setup input from gps or use test data under file name gps_stationary_test_data.txt
Specify in code to use test file or real data. Will add an option/property file to set this but for now hard coded is fine.
Test_code_ignore is where I run short code to see if they can be implemented in the main code. Files tend to be on the shorter side, but since they are not needed to run the app I have removed them from the repository
